# Configuration file for the gsisshd service.

# The server keys are automatically generated if they are missing.
# To change the automatic creation, adjust gsisshd.service options for
# example using  systemctl enable gsisshd-keygen@dsa.service  to allow creation
# of DSA key or  systemctl mask gsisshd-keygen@rsa.service  to disable RSA key
# creation.
